This folder contains the results from our manual literature search analyses.

* `literature_notes.txt` contains my notes from reading the papers.
* `literature_based_meta_analysis.txt` is a tab-delimited file with the univariate results reported in each paper
* `data_from_papers/` contains any supplemental information from the papers that I used to compile these

I'll have to put this data somewhere...
