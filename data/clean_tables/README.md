The cleaned up OTU tables and metadata files will be here.

"Clean" means that a certain amount of quality control has been done 
(e.g. removing samples with too few reads, removing OTUs which are too
rare, etc) and also that file contain only the subset of samples which have
both 16S and metadata information and which meet any condition(s) specified
in the yaml file (if any, e.g. stool sample, timepoint 1, etc).
